Ramaswamy, respectful of her honesty, disagreed with her stance. Despite agreeing with many of his views, Coulter cited his Indian heritage as a reason for not supporting his candidacy. This exchange has sparked debates online, with some defending Coulter's stance and others criticizing it as discriminatory. Ramaswamy, who eventually supported Donald Trump's candidacy, withdrew from the presidential race earlier this year.",
