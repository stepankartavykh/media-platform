            "description": "The Republican party is worried about 2024 losses that could occur as a result of election fraud claims pushed by Donald Trump, a GOP strategist said Sunday.Republican strategist Susan del Percio, who has a history of working with Republican candidates and in Rudy Giuliani's administration, appeared on MSNBC on Sunday, where she was asked about Lara Trump's recent claim that her father-in-law had accepted the election results from 2020.\"What does it mean if this is the person who is running the [Republican National Convention]?\" the host asked.ALSO READ: Judge rejects Fox News-inspired Georgia man who rained hate on school administrator\"There are a few things in play here,\" said del Percio. \"Republicans are worried about the stealing of the election claim, they saw what happened in 2022. Given the stories that we are seeing here now in 2024, Republicans know that it is a vulnerability for them.\"She added that Lara Trump \"is nothing but a show for her father.\"\"She should probably just spend her time in the recording studio because she is doing more harm than good as far as being the head of the R.N.C. She does not know what the job is,\" the strategist said Sunday. \"She only knows what she is told to do.\"Watch the video below or click the link.",

            "description": "Judge Aileen Cannon just did something \"contrary to what the law directs judges to do,\" a former federal prosecutor said on Sunday.Ex-prosecutor Joyce Vance, a legal analyst who frequently appears on MSNBC, over the weekend highlighted recent actions by Cannon, who is overseeing Donald Trump's criminal documents case out of Florida. Cannon has been accused of slow-walking the case, and her earlier decisions in the investigation phase of the case were reversed on appeal.Vance wrote for her Civil Discourse blog on Substack that there \"was little doubt before last week that federal Judge Aileen Cannon was determined to delay Trump’s criminal case in front of her—the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case—until after the election.\"ALSO READ: 'Most transparent president' Trump won't meet financial transparency deadline. Again.\"Now, there is none,\" the legal expert added. Vance went on to describe how, recently, Cannon refused to set a new trial date, citing a number of motions on which she has yet to rule. Some have said this could result in Special Counsel Jack Smith getting the opportunity to replace the judge.Vance highlighted the law itself, arguing that judges are required to set a trial date.\"This case could and should have been ready for trial in December or January if she had been working on the motions and realistic deadlines all along,\" she wrote. \"Judge Cannon’s action here bears a striking similarity to what Trump asked her to do back in July of 2023, when he and co-defendant Walt Nauta filed a joint motion asking her to 'postpone initial consideration of any rescheduled trial date until after substantive motions have been presented and adjudicated.' She didn’t then; she scheduled the May trial date. But now, she has given Trump what he wanted all along, and it’s contrary to what the law directs judges to do.\"Vance goes on to quote The Speedy Trial Act, which says, “In any case involving a defendant charged with an offense, the appropriate judicial officer, at the earliest practicable time, shall, after consultation with the counsel for the defendant and the attorney for the Government, set the case for trial on a day certain, or list it for trial on a weekly or other short-term trial calendar at a place within the judicial district, so as to assure a speedy trial.”\"Refusing to set a trial date is not what the rules authorize federal judges to do; in fact, the rules direct judges to set a trial date at the beginning of the case, before all of the motions are even filed,\" she wrote. \"Here, we have a Judge who won’t set a trial date because of eight motions that are still pending on her docket because she has refrained from deciding them.\"Read the post here.",

He'd gone into an abortion clinic with his wife. They took the pill, the chemical abortion, because now 50% of all abortions are chemical abortions,\" Campos-Duffy said. \"They said once you take that pill, you've got to take that second one and don't listen to anybody who tells you otherwise. Well, they didn't listen. They googled and they found a reversal pill.\"\"They got the reversal pill, and they're holding that baby perfect child, and they reverse the abortion so that they're doing abortion pill reversals. They're helping women,\" she added.Experts, however, have said there is no science to back up the claims that abortions can be safely reversed.
