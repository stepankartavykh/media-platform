            "description": "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory scientists have developed microcapacitors with ultrahigh energy and power density, paving the way for on-chip energy storage in electronic devices. Many readers have seen the populations of capacitors installed to computer motherboards and other power-intensive silicon chip circuit boards. The findings, published in the journal Nature, pave the way for advanced on-chip energy storage and power delivery in next-generation electronics. In the ongoing quest to make electronic devices ever smaller...",
