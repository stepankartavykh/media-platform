PORTLAND, PORTLAND, OR, UNITED STATES, June 27, 2024 /EINPresswire.com/ -- The touchless gesture recognition segment is expected to experience significant growth in the coming years, a significant acceptance in automobile infotainment centers, smart home electronics, and medical devices is driving the development of advanced touchless solutions, which is expected to boost the market growth. According to the report published by Allied Market Research, the global gesture recognition market garnered $13.9 billion in 2021, and is estimated to generate $88.2 billion by 2031, manifesting a CAGR of 20.6% from 2022 to 2031. The report provides an extensive analysis of changing market dynamics, major segments, value chain, competitive scenario, and regional landscape. This research offers valuable guidance to leading players, investors, shareholders, and startups in devising strategies for the sustainable growth and gaining competitive edge in the market. Request Sample Report at: https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/2479 Gesture recognition technology can be used in a variety of applications, such as human-computer interaction, virtual reality, robotics, and gaming. It has the potential to enhance user experience and make interactions more natural and intuitive, as it allows users to communicate with technology in a way that mimics real-world human interactions. Moreover, gesture recognition technology is still a rapidly evolving field, with ongoing R&D focused on improving its accuracy, speed, and versatility. As technology becomes more advanced and accessible, it has the potential to revolutionize the way firms are interacting with computers, devices, and each other. Furthermore, increasing demand for contactless interfaces and the rising popularity of gaming applications are driving the growth of the market. In addition, the increasing usage of smart devices in various industries is fueling the growth of the gesture recognition market. However, high development and implementation costs and high battery power consumption by gesture recognition components limit the growth of the market. Conversely, the growing demand for augmented and virtual reality applications is anticipated to provide numerous opportunities for the expansion of the market during the forecast period. For Report Customization: https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-for-customization/2479 Based on industry vertical, consumer electronics segment dominated the market in 2021 and is expected to continue its dominance during the forecast period, owing to the growing proliferation of smart home automation, and surge in demand for gaming and virtual & augmented reality solutions. However, the aerospace and defense segment is expected to witness the highest growth in the upcoming years, owing to the adoption of gesture recognition technology can enhance training by improving learning outcomes and reducing training costs. This factor is expected to drive segment growth globally. Region-wise, the gesture recognition market was dominated by North America in 2021 and is expected to maintain its position during the forecast period. Improvements in digital innovation and strengthened user experience are also acting as key forces for driving the growth of the North America gesture recognition market. However, Asia-Pacific is expected to witness significant growth during the forecast period. The rise in a number of digital transformation initiatives, along with the growing adoption of advanced technology, such as machine learning, data analytics, augmented reality, and virtual reality is expected to drive the gesture recognition market growth. Key Trends and Drivers: â€¢ Increasing Demand for Touchless Interfaces: The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the demand for touchless interfaces to reduce physical contact and the spread of viruses. â€¢ Advancements in Technology: Improvements in sensor technology, machine learning, and artificial intelligence have enhanced the accuracy and efficiency of gesture recognition systems. â€¢ Integration in Consumer Electronics: Devices like smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, and gaming consoles increasingly feature gesture recognition for enhanced user experience. â€¢ Automotive Applications: Gesture recognition is being integrated into vehicles for functions like controlling infotainment systems and other in-car functionalities, contributing to safer driving experiences. â€¢ Healthcare Sector: Gesture recognition is used in medical imaging and surgeries to allow hands-free operation of equipment, improving hygiene and convenience. Buy Now & Get Exclusive Report at: https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/gesture-recognition-market/purchase-options The COVID-19 pandemic has had a mixed impact on the gesture recognition market size. During the Covid, the demand for touchless gesture recognition systems has increased significantly due to the rise in need for contactless interactions to prevent the spread of the virus. Hence, healthcare, retail, and hospitality, are some of the key sectors that encouraging the adoption for gesture recognition solutions. On the other hand, the pandemic has also resulted in a slowdown of the global economy, which has had an adverse effect on the overall demand for innovative technologies, including gesture recognition. The pandemic has also disrupted global supply chains, leading to delays in the production and delivery of gesture recognition systems. Further, it is expected that the demand for touchless gesture recognition systems in various industries will continue to drive the growth of the market despite the impact of the pandemic. However, the growth rate may be slightly lower than initially anticipated due to the economic slowdown caused by the pandemic. Furthermore, the healthcare industry is yet another example of AR/VR gesture recognition applications. AR/VR applications are increasingly being adopted in surgical training, in order to practice surgical operations in a virtual environment where users can handle virtual objects using hand gestures. Hence, several companies and government authorities are investing in AR and VR technologies intending to improve user experience and efficient monitoring. For instance, in January 2023, Magic Leapâ€™s gained $450 million from the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF). Through this investment, the company owns almost half of Magic Leap business. Moreover, companies in the healthcare, manufacturing, and entertainment industries are also collaborating to improve industrial processes with significant technology integration, eventually creating numerous opportunities for market growth worldwide.
